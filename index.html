		<h1>Montserrat</h1>
		<h2> CHARACTER SET</h2>
		<p id="char_set">The old posters and signs in the traditional Montserrat neighborhood of Buenos Aires inspired
			Julieta Ulanovsky to design this typeface and rescue the beauty of urban typography that emerged in the
			first half of the twentieth century. As urban development changes that place, it will never return to its
			original form and loses forever the designs that are so special and unique. The letters that inspired this
			project have work, dedication, care, color, contrast, light and life, day and night! These are the types
			that make the city look so beautiful. The Montserrat Project began with the idea to rescue what is in
			Montserrat and set it free under a libre license, the SIL Open Font License.</p>

				<h3 class="social_anxiety"> SOCIAL ANXIETY</h3>
				<p class="social_paragraph"> Understanding social anxiety involves recognizing it as a common mental
					health condition characterized by an intense fear of social situations where one may be judged or
					scrutinized by others. Individuals with social anxiety often experience overwhelming feelings of
					self-consciousness, fear of embarrassment, and a strong desire to avoid social interactions
					altogether. This can manifest in physical symptoms like sweating, rapid heartbeat, and trembling.
					While many people feel nervous in social settings, social anxiety disorder (SAD) significantly
					impairs daily functioning and can hinder personal and professional relationships. Acknowledging
					these feelings and seeking support can be crucial steps toward managing and overcoming social
					anxiety.</p>
			</div>


			<div class="cope">
				<h3 class="coping">COPING MECHANISMS</h3>
				<p class="coping_paragraph">Coping strategies for social anxiety focus on building confidence and
					reducing fear in social situations. Techniques such as deep breathing and mindfulness can help calm
					the mind and body before interactions. Gradual exposure, where individuals slowly face feared social
					scenarios, allows for desensitization over time. Journaling can serve as an effective outlet for
					processing thoughts and emotions, while role-playing with trusted friends helps practice social
					skills in a low-pressure environment. Additionally, engaging in physical activities and maintaining
					a healthy lifestyle can improve overall well-being and resilience against anxiety. Combining these
					strategies can empower individuals to navigate social situations more comfortably. </p>
			</div>


			<div class="self-c">
				<h3 class="self"> SELF-CARE</h3>
				<p class="self_paragraph">Self-care practices for social anxiety are essential for fostering resilience
					and well-being. Establishing a consistent routine that includes physical activity, such as walking
					or yoga, can help alleviate anxiety symptoms and boost mood. Mindfulness techniques, like meditation
					or deep breathing exercises, promote relaxation and present-moment awareness. Engaging in creative
					outlets, such as art or writing, provides a constructive way to express feelings and reduce stress.
					Additionally, prioritizing quality sleep and maintaining a balanced diet can enhance overall mental
					health. By incorporating these self-care strategies, individuals can cultivate a supportive
					environment that encourages self-acceptance and confidence in social situations.</p>
